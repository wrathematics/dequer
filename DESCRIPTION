Title: Stacks, Queues, and 'Deques' for R
Version: 2.0-0
Description: Stacks, queues, and 'deques' are list-like, abstract data types. 
    These are meant to be very cheap to "grow", or insert new objects into.
    A typical use case involves storing data in a list in a streaming fashion,
    when you do not necessarily know how may elements need to be stored.
    Unlike R's lists, data the new data structures provided here is not
    necessarily stored contiguously, making insertions and deletions at the
    front/end of the structure much faster.  The underlying implementation here
    is new and uses a doubly linked list, and thus does not rely on R's
    environments or hashing.  To avoid unnecessary data copying, most operations
    on these data structures are performed via side-effects.
